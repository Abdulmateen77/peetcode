## Peetcode
Added code run functionality for python and c++, using nodejs child_process module. It creates a child process that I used to execute the code. I created a temporary file to store the code, then compile and execute it. Then it checks if the output is as desired.  </br>
You need to print the answer to stdout, not just return it. </br>
For example, for problem 205. Add Two Numbers, if you print 300, it will display AC, WA otherwise. <br/>

```
npm install 
npm install uuid@latest
pm2 start index.js
```
